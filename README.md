<h1 align="center">🔥 Hot Wheels Drop Notifier</h1>
<p align="center">
  🚗 I made this for myself so I can get notified whenever new hot wheels stock comes out on this website which sells the cars at the lowest price. I dont want to check the website continuously so I get notified instantly via email when new Hot Wheels cars appear on <a href="https://www.toymarche.com/brand/hot-wheels">ToyMarche</a>.
  <br/>
  No need to keep refreshing. It checks for you every 1 hour!
